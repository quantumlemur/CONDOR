CONDOR is a set of scripts designed to evaluate the performance of rotorcraft, size them for a given mission, and develop data sets of rotorcraft performance figures across a large design space.

•   rf.py is the actual RF method, used for sizing a single vehicle for a given mission.
•   vehicle.py evaluates a single vehicle at a single weight point.
•   BEMT.py contains the actual blade-element routines
•   designSpaceGenerator.py is used to generate large data sets of sized vehicles, for statistical analysis.
•   parameterSweep.py sizes vehicles across a spread of desired mission ranges and speeds, and can output figures.
•   payloadRangeCurve.py creates payload-range curves
•   makeFigures.py can be used as an example for how to create a few important figures, and is included for reference.
